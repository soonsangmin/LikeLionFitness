        <h1>Food for Thought</h1>
        <img width="30%" src="img/nutrition1.jpg" alt="fitness1"></img>
        <p>Good nutrition is a lifestyle, not a diet. It starts with a new way of thinking about food. Think of your body as a vehicle that uses food for fuel. Fill your tank with the right type of fuel.</p>
        <p>Do not approach your nutrition plan as a diet plan, but rather, a Lifestyle change. Tf you make a permanent change, you will see big results. The key to success is a daily focus on your goal.</p>
        <p>Portion your meals and track your calories. There are many free mobile apps available to help track your activity level and calories.</p>
        <p>Control impulsive urges to buy junk food, and instead, allow yourself to one "cheat" meal a week.</p>

          <li>Vegetables, but avoid corn and peas</li>
          <li>Fruit</li>
          <li>Fat, such as olive oil, and seeds</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Limit the consumption of bread, pasta, white potatoes, and processed food. These foods are high in carbohydrates.</p>
